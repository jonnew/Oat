__Oat__ is a set of programs for processing images, extracting object position
information, and streaming data to disk and/or the network in real-time.  Oat
subcommands are independent programs that each perform a single operation but
that can communicate through shared memory. This allows a user to chain
operations together in arrangements suitable for particular context or tracking
requirement. This architecture enables scripted construction of custom data
processing chains. Oat is primarily used for real-time animal position tracking
in the context of experimental neuroscience, but can be used in any
circumstance that requires real-time object tracking.

## Manual
### Introduction
Oat's design is influenced by the [UNIX
philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy), [suckless
tools](http://suckless.org/philosophy), and
[MEABench](http://www.danielwagenaar.net/res/software/meabench/). Oat consists
of a set of small, composable programs (called **components**). Components are
equipped with standard interfaces that permit communication through shared
memory to capture, process, and record video streams.  Currently, Oat
components act on two basic data types: `frames` and `positions`.

* `frame` - Video frame.
* `position` - 2D position.

Oat components can be chained together to realize custom dataflow networks that
operate on instances of the aforementioned datatypes, called **tokens**.  Token
processing pipelines can be split and merged while maintaining thread-safety
and sample synchronization.  The [messaging library](lib/shmemdf) underlying
the communication between Oat components has been optimized to reduce token
copying. For instance, `frame` passing is performed using a
[zero-copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-copy) protocol. This means that
passing `frames` between components in a user-configured processing network
incurs almost no memory or CPU cost compared to the
[monolithc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application) equivalent.
Further, great care was taken during implementations of Oat components to
minimize time spent in [critical
sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_section). This means that
individual components execute largely in parallel, even when components are
highly interdependent, facilitating efficient use of multi-core CPUs and
GPU-based processing acceleration.

To get a feel for how Oat is used, here is a script to detect the position of a
single object in pre-recorded video file:

```bash
# Serve frames from a video file to the 'raw' stream
oat frameserve file raw -f ./video.mpg &

# Perform background subtraction on the 'raw' stream
# Serve the result to the 'filt' stream
# If an appropriately configured GPU is available, this process will
# use it
oat framefilt mog raw filt &

# Perform color-based object position detection on the 'filt' stream
# Serve the object positionto the 'pos' stream. Allow parameter tuning
# through a simple GUI.
oat posidet hsv filt pos --tune &

# Decorate the 'raw' stream with the detected position form the `pos` stream
# Serve the decorated images to the 'dec' stream
oat decorate -p pos raw dec &

# View the 'dec' stream
oat view dec &

# Record the 'dec' and 'pos' streams to file in the current directory
oat record -i dec -p pos -f ./
```

This script has the following graphical representation:

```
frameserve --> framefilt --> posidet --> decorate ---> view
           \                           /         \
             -------------------------             --> record
```

Generally, an Oat component is called in the following pattern:

```
oat <subcommand> [TYPE] [IO] [CONFIGURATION]
```
The `<subcommand>` indicates the component that will be executed. Components
are classified according to their type signature. For instance, `framefilt`
(frame filter) accepts a frame and produces a frame. `posifilt` (position
filter) accepts a position and produces a position. `frameserve` (frame server)
produces a frame, and so on.  The `TYPE` parameter specifies a concrete type of
transform (e.g. for the `framefilt` subcommand, this could be `bsub` for
background subtraction).  The `IO` specification indicates where the component
will receive data from and to where the processed data should be published. The
`CONFIGURATION` specification is used to provide parameters to shape the
component's operation.  Aside from command line options and switches, which are
listed using the `--help` option for each subcommand, the user can often
provide an external file containing a configuration table to pass parameters to
a component. Some configuration parameters can only be specified using a
configuration file.  Configuration files are written in plain text using
[TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml). A multi-component processing script
can share a configuration file because each component accesses parameter
information using a file/key pair, like so

```toml
[key]
parameter_0 = 1                 # Integer
parameter_1 = true              # Boolean
parameter_2 = 3.14              # Double
parameter_3 = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]   # Array of doubles
```

or more concretely,

```toml
# Example configuration file for frameserve --> framefilt
[frameserve-config]
frame_rate = 30                 # FPS
roi = [10, 10, 100, 100]        # Region of interest

[framefilt-config]
mask = "~/Desktop/mask.png"     # Path to mask file
```

The type and sanity of parameter values are checked by Oat before they are
used. Below, the type signature, usage information, available configuration
parameters, examples, and configuration options are provided for each Oat
component.

### Frame Server
`oat-frameserve` - Serves video streams to shared memory from physical devices
(e.g. webcam or GIGE camera) or from file.

#### Signature
    oat-frameserve --> frame

#### Usage
```
Usage: frameserve [INFO]
   or: frameserve TYPE SINK [CONFIGURATION]
Serve image stream to a frame SINK

TYPE:
  wcam: Onboard or USB webcam.
  gige: Point Grey GigE camera.
  file: Video from file (*.mpg, *.avi, etc.).
  test: Write-free static image server for performance testing.

SINK:
  User-supplied name of the memory segment to publish frames to (e.g. raw).

OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS:

INFO:
  --help                 Produce help message.
  -v [ --version ]       Print version information.

CONFIGURATION:
  -i [ --index ] arg     Index of camera to capture images from.
  -f [ --file ] arg      Path to video file if 'file' is selected as the server
                         TYPE.
                         Path to image file if 'test' is selected as the server
                         TYPE.
  -r [ --fps ] arg       Frames per second. Overriden by information in
                         configuration file if provided.
  -c [ --config ] arg    Configuration file/key pair.
```

#### Configuration File Options
__TYPE = `gige`__

- __`index`__=`+int` User specified camera index. Useful in multi-camera
  imaging configurations.
- __`fps`__=`+float` Acquisition frame rate (Hz). Ignored if `trigger_on=true`
  and `enforce_fps=false`.  If unspecified, then the maximum frame rate will be
  used.
- __`exposure`__=`float` Automatically adjust both shutter and gain to
  achieve given exposure (EV).
- __`shutter`__=`+float` Shutter time in milliseconds. Specifying `exposure`
  overrides this option.
- __`gain`__=`float` Sensor gain value. Specifying `exposure` overrides this
  option (dB).
- __`white_bal`__=`{red=+int, blue=+int}` White-balance specified as red/blue
  intensity values (0-1000).
- __`roi`__=`{x_offset=+int, y_offset=+int, width=+int, height+int}` Region of
  interest to extract from the camera or video stream (pixels).
- __`trigger_on`__=`bool` True to use camera trigger, false to use software
  polling.
- __`trigger_rising`__=`bool` True to trigger on rising edge, false to
  trigger on falling edge.
- __`trigger_mode`__=`+int` Point-grey trigger mode. Common values are:
    - 0 - Standard external trigger. Trigger edge causes sensor exposure, then
      sensor readout to internal memory.
    - 1 - Blub shutter mode. Same as 0, except that sensor exposure duration is
      determined by trigger active duration.
    - 7 - Continuous internal trigger. No external trigger required, but not
      synchronized to an external clock.
    - 14 - Overlapped exposure/readout external trigger. Sensor exposure occurs
      during sensory readout to internal memory. This is the fastest external
      trigger mode.
- __`trigger_pin`__=`+int` Hardware pin number on Point-grey camera that
  trigger is sent to.
- __`strobe_pin`__=`+int` Hardware pin number on Point-grey camera that
  a gate signal for the camera shutter is copied  to.
- __`enforce_fps`__=`bool`If true, ensures that frames are produced at the
  `fps` setting by retransmitting frames if the requested period is exceeded.
  This is sometimes needed in the case of an external trigger because PG
  cameras sometimes just ignore them. I have opened a support ticket on this,
  but PG has no solution yet.

__TYPE = `file`__

- __`fps`__=`float` Target frame rate in frames per second. If left undefined,
  frames will be read as quickly as possible.
- __`roi`__=`{x_offset=+int, y_offset=+int, width=+int, height+int}` Region of
  interest to extract from the camera or video stream (pixels).

__TYPE = `wcam`__

- __`index`__=`+int` User specified camera index. Useful in multi-camera
  imaging configurations.


#### Examples
```bash
# Serve to the 'wraw' stream from a webcam
oat frameserve wcam wraw

# Stream to the 'graw' stream from a point-grey GIGE camera
# using the gige_config tag from the config.toml file
oat frameserve gige graw -c config.toml gige_config

# Serve to the 'fraw' stream from a previously recorded file

```

#### Configuration File Options
__TYPE = `mean`__

- __`heading_anchor`__=`+int` Index of the SOURCE position to use as an anchor
  when calculating object heading. In this case the heading equals the mean
  directional vector between this anchor position and all other SOURCE
  positions. If unspecified, the heading is not calculated.

#### Example
```bash
# Generate the geometric mean of 'pos1' and 'pos2' streams
# Publish the result to the 'com' stream
oat posicom mean pos1 pos2 com
```

### Frame Decorator
`oat-decorate` - Annotate frames with sample times, dates, and/or positional
information.

#### Signature
         frame --> |
    position 0 --> |
    position 1 --> | oat-decorate --> frame
      :            |
    position N --> |

#### Usage
```
Usage: decorate [INFO]
   or: decorate SOURCE SINK [CONFIGURATION]

number. Publish decorated frames to SINK.

SOURCE:
  User-supplied name of the memory segment from which frames are received (e.g.
  raw).

SINK:
  User-supplied name of the memory segment to publish frames to (e.g. out).

OPTIONS:

INFO:
  --help                        Produce help message.
  -v [ --version ]              Print version information.

CONFIGURATION:
  -p [ --position-sources ] arg  The name of position server(s) used to draw

oat decorate raw -s

# Add position markers to each frame from the 'raw' stream to indicate
# objection positions for the 'pos1' and 'pos2' streams
oat decorate raw -p pos1 pos2
```

\newpage
### Recorder
`oat-record` - Save frame and position streams to file.

* `frame` streams are compressed and saved as individual video files (
  [H.264](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC) compression format AVI
  file).
* `position` streams are combined into a single [JSON](http://json.org/) file.
  Position files have the following structure:

```
{oat-version: X.X},
{header: {timestamp: YYYY-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss},
         {sample_rate_hz: X.X},
         {sources: [ID_1, ID_2, ..., ID_N]} }
{positions: [ [ID_1: position, ID_2: position, ..., ID_N: position ],
              [ID_1: position, ID_2: position, ..., ID_N: position ],

              [ID_1: position, ID_2: position, ..., ID_N: position ] }
}
```
where each `position` object is defined as:

```
{
  samp: Int,                  | Sample number
  unit: Int,                  | Enum spcifying length units (0=pixels, 1=meters)
  pos_ok: Bool,               | Boolean indicating if position is valid
  pos_xy: [Double, Double],   | Position x,y values
  vel_ok: Bool,               | Boolean indicating if velocity is valid
  vel_xy: [Double, Double],   | Velocity x,y values
  head_ok: Bool,              | Boolean indicating if heading  is valid
  head_xy: [Double, Double],  | Heading x,y values
  reg_ok: Bool,               | Boolean indicating if region tag  is valid
  reg: String                 | Region tag
}
```
Data fields are only populated if the values are valid. For instance, in the
case that only object position is valid, and the object velocity, heading, and
region information are not calculated, an example position data point would
look like this:
```
{ samp: 501,
  unit: 0,
  pos_ok: True,
  pos_xy: [300.0, 100.0],
  vel_ok: False,
  head_ok: False,
  reg_ok: False }
```

All streams are saved with a single recorder have the same base file name and
save location (see usage). Of course, multiple recorders can be used in
parallel to (1) parallelize the computational load of video compression, which
tends to be quite intense and (2) save to multiple locations simultaneously.

#### Usage
```
Usage: record [INFO]
   or: record [CONFIGURATION]
Record frame and/or position streams.

OPTIONS:

  --help                         Produce help message.
  -v [ --version ]               Print version information.

CONFIGURATION:
  -n [ --filename ] arg          The base file name to which to source name
                                 will be appended
  -f [ --folder ] arg            The path to the folder to which the video
                                 stream and position information will be saved.
  -d [ --date ]                  If specified, YYYY-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss_ will be
                                 prepended to the filename.
  -a [ --prepend-source ]        If specified, the source name will be
                                 prepended to the filename, after the data, if
                                 selected
  -o [ --allow-overwrite ]       If set and save path matches and existing
                                 file, the file will be overwritten instead of
                                 a numerical index being added to the file
                                 path.
  -c [ --concise-file ]          If set, indeterminate position data fields
                                 will not be written e.g. pos_xy will not be be
                                 written even when pos_ok = false. This means
                                 that position objects will be of variable size
                                 depending on the validity on whether a
                                 position was detected or not, potentially
                                 complicating file parsing.
  -p [ --position-sources ] arg  The names of the POSITION SOURCES that supply

                                 socket with ZMQ style endpoint specifier:
                                 '<transport>://<host>:<port>'. For instance,
                                 'tcp://*:5555' or 'ipc://*:5556' specify TCP
                                 and interprocess communication on ports 5555
                                 or 5556, respectively
  -s [ --frame-sources ] arg     The names of the FRAME SOURCES that supply
                                 images to save to video.
```

#### Example

```bash
# Save positional stream 'pos' to current directory
oat record -p pos

# Save positional stream 'pos1' and 'pos2' to current directory
oat record -p pos1 pos2

# Save positional stream 'pos1' and 'pos2' to Desktop directory and

oat record -s raw -p pos -d -f ~/Desktop -n test
```

\newpage
### Position Socket
`oat-posisock` - Stream detected object positions to the network in either
client or server configurations.

#### Signature
    position --> oat-posisock

#### Usage
```

Usage: posisock [INFO]
   or: posisock TYPE SOURCE [ENDPOINT]
Send positions from SOURCE to a remote endpoint.

TYPE:
  std: Asynchronous position dump to stdout.
  pub: Asynchronous position publisher over ZMQ socket.
       Publishes positions without request to potentially many
       subscribers.
  rep: Synchronous position replier over ZMQ socket.
       Sends positions in response to requests from a single
       endpoint.Several transport/protocol options. The most
       useful are tcp and interprocess (ipc).
  udp: Asynchronous, client-side, unicast user datagram protocol
       over a traditional BSD-style socket.

ENDPOINT:
Device to send positions to.
  When TYPE is pos or rep, this is specified using a ZMQ-style
  endpoint: '<transport>://<host>:<port>'. For instance,
  'tcp://*:5555' or 'ipc://*:5556' specify TCP and interprocess
  communication on ports 5555 or 5556, respectively
  When TYPE is udp, this is specified as '<host> <port>'
  For instance, '10.0.0.1 5555'.

INFO:
  --help                 Produce help message.
  -v [ --version ]       Print version information.

```

#### Example
```bash
# Reply to requests for positions from the 'pos' stream to port 5555 using TCP
oat posisock rep pos tcp://*:5555

# Asychronously publish positions from the 'pos' stream to port 5556 using TCP
oat posisock pub pos tcp://*:5556

# Dump positions from the 'pos' stream to stdout
oat posisock std pos
```

\newpage
### Buffer
`oat-buffer` - A first in, first out (FIFO) token buffer that can be use to
decouple asynchronous portions of a data processing network. An example of this
is the case when a precise external clock is used to govern image acquisition
via a physical trigger line. In this case, 'hickups' in the data processing
network following the camera should not cause the camera to skip frames. Of
course, there is no free lunch: if the processing pipline cannot keep up with
the external clock on average, then the buffer will eventually fill and
overflow.

#### Signatures
    position --> oat-buffer --> position

    frame --> oat-buffer --> frame

#### Usage
```
Usage: buffer [INFO]
   or: buffer TYPE SOURCE SINK [CONFIGURATION]
Place tokens from SOURCE into a FIFO. Publish tokens in FIFO to SINK.

TYPE
  frame: Frame buffer
  pos2D: 2D Position buffer

SOURCE:
  User-supplied name of the memory segment to receive tokens from (e.g. input).

SINK:
  User-supplied name of the memory segment to publish tokens to (e.g. output).

OPTIONS:

INFO:
  --help                 Produce help message.
  -v [ --version ]       Print version information.
```

#### Example
```bash
# Acquire frames on a gige camera driven by an exnternal trigger
oat frameserve gige raw -c config.toml gige-trig

# Buffer the frames separate asychronous sections of the processing network
oat buffer frame raw buff

# Filter the buffered frames and save
oat framefilt mog buff filt
oat record -f ~/Desktop/ -p buff filt
```

In the above example, one must be careful to fully separate the network across
the buffer boundary in order for it to provide any functionality. For instance,
if we changed the record command to the following
```bash
oat record -f ~/Desktop/ -p raw filt
```
Then the buffer would do nothing since the raw token stream must be synchronous
with the recorder, which bypasses the buffer. In this case, the buffer is just
wasting CPU cycles. Here is a graphical representation of the first
configuration where the `oat-buffer` is used properly. The synchronization
boundary is shown using vertical lines.

```
               |
frameserve --> buffer --> framefilt --> record
               |    \                  /
               |     ------------------
```

In the second configuration, the connection from frameserve to record breaks
the synchronization boundary.
```
               |
frameserve --> buffer --> framefilt --> record
          \    |                      /
           ----|----------------------
```

```

\newpage

### Kill
`oat-kill` - Issue SIGINT to all running Oat processes started by the calling
user. A side effect of Oat's architecture is that components can become
orphaned in certain circumstances: abnormal termination of attached sources or
sinks, running pure sources in the background and forgetting about them, etc.
This utility will gracefully interrupt all currently running oat components.

#### Usage
```
Usage: kill
```

#### Example
```bash
# Interupt all currenly running oat components
oat kill
```

\newpage

### Clean
`oat-clean` - Programmer's utility for cleaning shared memory segments after
following abnormal component termination. Not required unless a program
terminates without cleaning up shared memory. If you are using this for things
other than development, then please submit a bug report.

#### Usage
```
Usage: clean [INFO]
   or: clean NAMES [CONFIGURATION]
Remove the named shared memory segments specified by NAMES.

INFO:
  --help                Produce help message.
  -v [ --version ]      Print version information.
  -q [ --quiet ]        Quiet mode. Prevent output text.
  -l [ --legacy ]       Legacy mode. Append  "_sh_mem" to input NAMES before
                        removing.
```

#### Example
```bash
# Remove raw and filt blocks from shared memory after abnormal terminatiot of
# some components that created them
oat clean raw filt
```

\newpage

## Installation
First, ensure that you have installed all dependencies required for the
components and build configuration you are interested in in using. For more
information on dependencies, see the [dependencies](#dependencies) section
below. To compile and install Oat, starting in the top project directory,
create a build directory, navigate to it, and run cmake on the top-level
CMakeLists.txt like so:

```bash
mkdir release
cd release
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release [CMAKE OPTIONS] ..
make
make install
```

If you just want to build a single component component, individual components
can be built using `make [component-name]`, e.g. `make oat-view`. Available
cmake options and their default values are:

```
-DUSE_FLYCAP=On // Compile with support for Point Grey Cameras
-DBUILD_DOCS=Off     // Generate Doxygen documentation
```

If you had to install Boost from source, you must let cmake know where it is
installed via the following switch. Obviously, provide the correct path to the
installation on your system.

```
-DBOOST_ROOT=/opt/boost_1_59_0
```

To complete installation, add the following to your `.bashrc` or equivalent.
This makes Oat commands available within your user profile (once you start a new terminal):

```bash
# Make Oat commands available to user
eval "$(path/to/Oat/oat/bin/oat init -)"
```

### Dependencies
#### License compatibility

Oat is licensed under the
[GPLv3.0](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/). Its dependences' are
licenses are shown below:

- Flycapture SDK: NON-FREE specialized license (This is an optional package. If
  you compile without Flycapture support, you can get around this. Also, see
  the `GigE interface cleanup` entry in the TODO section for a potentially free
  alternative.
- OpenCV: BSD
- ZeroMQ: LGPLv3.0
- Boost: Boost software license
- cpptoml: Some kind of Public Domain Dedication
- RapidJSON: BSD
- Catch: Boost software license

These licenses do not violate the terms of Oat's license. If you feel otherwise
please submit an bug report.

#### Flycapture SDK
The FlyCapture SDK is used to communicate with Point Grey digital cameras. It
is not required to compile any Oat components.  However, the Flycapture SDK is
required if a Point Grey camera is to be to be used with the `oat-frameserve`
component to acquire images. If you simply want to process pre-recorded files
or use a web cam, e.g. via

```
oat-frameserve file raw -f video.mpg
oat-frameserve wcam raw
```

then this library is _not_ required.

To install the Point Grey SDK:

- Go to [point-grey website](www.ptgrey.com)
- Download the FlyCapture2 SDK (version >= 2.7.3). Annoyingly, this requires you
  to create an account with Point Grey.
- Extract the archive and use the `install_flycapture.sh` script to install the
  SDK on your computer and run

```bash
tar xf flycapture.tar.gz
cd flycapture
sudo ./install_flycapture
```

#### Boost
The [Boost libraries](http://www.boost.org/) are required to compile all Oat
components. You will need to install versions >= 1.56. To
install Boost, use APT or equivalent,

```bash
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```

If you are using an Ubuntu distribution older than Wily Werewolf, Boost will be
too old and you will need to install from source via

```bash
# Install latest boost
wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/latest/download?source=files -O tarboost
tar -xf tarboost
cd ./boost*
./bootstrap.sh
./b2 --with-program_options --with-system --with-thread
cd ..
sudo mv boost* /opt
```

#### OpenCV
[opencv](http://opencv.org/) is required to compile the following oat components:

- `oat-frameserve`
- `oat-framefilt`
- `oat-view`
- `oat-record`
- `oat-posidet`
- `oat-posifilt`
- `oat-decorate`
- `oat-positest`

__Note__: OpenCV must be installed with ffmpeg support in order for offline
analysis of pre-recorded videos to occur at arbitrary frame rates. If it is
not, gstreamer will be used to serve from video files at the rate the files
were recorded. No cmake flags are required to configure the build to use
ffmpeg. OpenCV will be built with ffmpeg support if something like

```
-- FFMPEG:          YES
-- codec:           YES (ver 54.35.0)
-- format:          YES (ver 54.20.4)
-- util:            YES (ver 52.3.0)
-- swscale:         YES (ver 2.1.1)
```

appears in the cmake output text. The dependencies required to compile OpenCV
with ffmpeg support, can be obtained as follows:

```bash
TODO
```

__Note__: To increase Oat's video visualization performance using `oat view`,
you can build OpenCV with OpenGL and/or OpenCL support. Both will open up
significant processing bandwidth to other Oat components and make for faster
processing pipelines. To compile OpenCV with OpenGL and OpenCL support, first
install dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install libgtkglext1 libgtkglext1-dev
```

Then, add the `-DWITH_OPENGL=ON` and the `-DWITH_OPENCL=ON` flags to the cmake
command below.  OpenCV will be build with OpenGL and OpenCL support if `OpenGL
support: YES` and `Use OpenCL: YES` appear in the cmake output text. If OpenCV
is compiled with OpenCL and OpenGL support, the performance benefits will be
automatic, no compiler options need to be set for Oat.

__Note__: If you have [NVIDIA GPU that supports
CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus), you can build OpenCV with CUDA
support to enable GPU accelerated video processing.  To do this, will first
need to install the [CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit).

- Be sure to __carefully__ read the [installation
  instructions](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-getting-started-guide-for-linux/index.html)
  since it is a multistep process. Here are some additional hints that worked
  for me:
- I have found that installing the toolkit via 'runfile' to be the most
  painless. To do this you will need to switch your system to text mode using
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F1</kbd>, and killing the X-server
  via `sudo service lightdm stop` (or equivalent), and running the runfile with
  root privileges.
- I have had the most success on systems that do not use GNOME or other fancy
  desktop environments. The install on [lubunut](http://lubuntu.net/), which
  uses LXDE as its desktop environment, was especially smooth.
- Do __not__ install the nvidia drivers along with the CUDA toolkit
  installation. I found that (using ubuntu 14.04) this causes all sorts of
  issues with X, cinnamon, etc, to the point where I could not even boot my
  computer into anything but text mode. Instead, install the NVIDIA drivers
  using either the package manager (`nvidia-current`) or even more preferably,
  using the [`device-drivers`]'(http://askubuntu.com/a/476659) program or
  equivalent.
- If you hare getting a `cv::exception` complaining that about
  `code=30(cudaErrorUnknown) "cudaGetDeviceCount(&device_count)"` or similar,
  run the affected command as [root one
  time](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/699610/linux/334-21-driver-returns-999-on-cuinit-cuda-/).

If OpenCV is compiled with CUDA suport, the CUDA-enabled portions of the Oat
codebase will be enabled automatically. No compile flags are required.

__Note__: GUI functionality is enhanced in OpenCV is compiled with Qt support.
You can build OpenCV with Qt by first installing the [Qt
SDK](http://download.qt.io/official_releases/online_installers/qt-unified-linux-x64-online.run)
and these dependencies:

```
# Additional dependencies for integraged QT with OpenGL
sudo apt-get install libqt5opengl5 libqt5opengl5-dev
```

The you can compile OpenCV using QT support by adding `-DWITH_QT=ON` flag to
the cmake command below. QT functionality will then be used by Oat
automatically.

Finally, to compile and install OpenCV:

```bash
# Install OpenCV's dependencies
sudo apt-get install build-essential # Compiler
sudo apt-get install cmake git libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev# Required
sudo apt-get install python-dev python-numpy libtbb2 libtbb-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libjasper-dev libdc1394-22-dev
sudo apt-get install # ffmpeg support [TODO]
sudo apt-get install # OpenGL support [TODO]
sudo ldconfig -v

# Get OpenCV
wget https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/archive/3.0.0-rc1.zip -O opencv.zip
unzip opencv.zip -d opencv

# Build OpenCV
cd opencv/opencv-3.0.0-rc1
mkdir release
cd release

# Run cmake to generate Makefile
# Add -DWITH_CUDA=ON for CUDA support and -DWITH_OPENGL for OpenGL support
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..

# Build the project and install
make
sudo make install
```

##  Setting up a Point-grey PGE camera in Linux
`oat-frameserve` supports using Point Grey GIGE cameras to collect frames. I
found the setup process to be straightforward and robust, but only after
cobbling together the following notes.

### Camera IP Address Configuration
First, assign your camera a static IP address. The easiest way to do this is to
use a Windows machine to run the Point Grey 'GigE Configurator'. If someone
knows a way to do this without Windows, please tell me. An example IP
Configuration might be:

- Camera IP: 192.168.0.1
- Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
- Default gateway: 192.168.0.64

### Point Grey GigE Host Adapter Card Configuration
Using network manager or something similar, you must configure the IPv4
configuration of the GigE host adapter card you are using to interface the
camera with your computer.

- First, set the ipv4 method to __manual__.
- Next, you must configure the interface to (1) have the same network prefix
  and (2) be on the same subnet as the camera you setup in the previous
  section.
    - Assuming you used the camera IP configuration specified above, your host
      adapter card should be assigned the following private IPv4 configuration:
          - POE gigabit card IP: 192.168.0.100
          - Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
          - DNS server IP: 192.168.0.1
- Next, you must enable jumbo frames on the network interface. Assuming that
  the camera is using `eth2`, then entering

        sudo ifconfig eth2 mtu 9000

  into the terminal will enable 9000 MB frames for the `eth2` adapter.
- Finally, to prevent image tearing, you should increase the amount of memory
  Linux uses for network receive buffers using the `sysctl` interface by typing

        sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=1048576 net.core.rmem_default=1048576

  into the terminal. _In order for these changes to persist after system
  reboots, the following lines must be added to the bottom of the
  `/etc/sysctl.conf` file_:

        net.core.rmem_max=1048576
        net.core.rmem_default=1048576

  These settings can then be reloaded after reboot using

        sudo sysctl -p

### Multiple Cameras
- If you have two or more cameras/host adapter cards,  they can be configured
  as above but _must exist on a separate subnets_. For instance, we could
  repeat the above configuration steps for a second camera/host adapter card
  using the following settings:
    - Camera Configuration:
          - Camera IP: 192.168.__1__.1
          - Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
          - Default gateway: 192.168.__1__.64
    - Host adapter configuration:
          - POE gigabit card IP: 192.168.__1__.100
          - Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
          - DNS server IP: 192.168.__1__.1

### Example Camera Configuration
Below is an example network adapter and camera configuration for a two-camera
imaging system provided by [Point Grey](http://www.ptgrey.com/). It consists of
two Blackfly GigE cameras (Point Grey part number: BFLY-PGE-09S2C) and a single
dual-port POE GigE adapter card (Point Grey part number: GIGE-PCIE2-2P02).

## TODO
- [ ] ~~Mac, Windows builds?~~
  - EDIT: Wait till someobody cares enough to do it.
- [ ] Unit and stress testing
    - Unit tests for `libshmemdf`
        - ~~Nominal data types, `T`~~
        - Specializations for `Frames`
    - Stress tests for data processing chains
        - I need to come up with a series of scripts that configure and run
          components in odd and intensive, but legal, ways to ensure sample
          sychronization is maintained, graceful exits, etc
- [ ] GigE interface cleanup
    - ~~The PGGigeCam class is a big mess. It has has tons of code redundancy.~~
        - EDIT: A lot of this is due to the PG API. I've cleaned up a bit, but
          more would be a waste of time.
    - ~~`oat frameserve gige` can wait indefinitely if the cameras use an
      external trigger and that trigger source stops before the process is
      interrupted. Need a timed wait there.~~
        - EDIT: Fixed in
          [a0c97e56bbe66227b03dd9253fdff33f0550465b](https://github.com/jonnew/Oat/commit/a0c97e56bbe66227b03dd9253fdff33f0550465b)
    - Should I be using the generic [GenICam API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GenICam)
      instead of PG's non-standard API? e.g. [Aravis](https://github.com/GNOME/aravis).
    - ~~Additionally, it needs to be optimized for performance. Are their
      unnessesary copies of images being made during conversion from PG Image
      to cv::Mat? Can I employ some move casts to help?~~
        - EDIT: shmemdf takes care of this.
    - There are a couple examples of GigE interfaces in OpenCV targeting other
      3rd party APIs: `modules/videoio/src/cap_giganetix.cpp` and
      `opencv/modules/videoio/src/cap_pvapi.cpp`. I don't know that these are
      great pieces of code, but I should at least use them for inspiration.
    - `oat-frameserve gige` lacks the ability to set FPS in free running
      (non-triggered mode)
    - ~~Configuration of the camera can get into impossible states if oat is used
      in combo with other programs that mess with the camera's registers.
      Configuration via Oat should start with a clean slate by setting the
      camera to a default register state.~~
      - ~~See flycap --> advanced camera settings --> restor default memory
        channel for how.~~
    - Binning should be specified in terms of mode number (see pg. 66 of
      blackfly tech ref) instead of bin size since not all bin sizes are
      allowed.
- [ ] Position type generalization
    - It might be a good idea to generalize the concept of a position to a
      multi-positional element
    - For things like the decorator, position combiner, and potentially
      detector, this could increase performance and decrease user script
      complexity if multiple targets common detection features needed to be
      tracked at once.
    - Down side is that it potentially increases code complexity and would
      require a significant refactor.
    - Additionally, position detection might no longer be stateless. E.g. think
      of the case when two detected objects cross paths. In order to ID the
      objects correctly in subsequent detections, the path of the objects would
      need to be taken into account (and there is not guarantee this result
      will be correct...). A potential work around is to have IDed 'position
      groups' with annoymous position members. This would get us back to
      stateless detection. However, it would make the concept of position
      combining hard to define (although that is even true now is just a design
      choice, really).
- [ ] Saving tuning parameters
    - Components that have a `--tune` option should also allow for the user to
      press a key and those tuning paramters to be injected into the current
      `config.toml` file so that they don't have to write them down and
      manually edit the file later
- [ ] Colors
    - ~~Should visual ID information (e.g. color) be integrated into the
      `position` type.~~
        - EDIT: No. What does position have to do with color? Sound? Touch? or
          ...
    - All this output color formatting might be very stupid because it screws
      up log files when stdout or stderr are piped to file.
- [ ] It would be good to warn people if the inputs to a multisource component
  have different sample rates because the output rate will be enforced by the
  slowest source.
- [x] Something is wrong with sample synchronization
    - When working with Jennie's data, we found that position samples were
      being recorded multiple times - they had the same sample number and
      position info. Seems to be very intermittent, but points to a serious
      issue with sample synchronization. It seems likely this occurring in the
      recorder component due to its mulitthreaded implementation.
    - EDIT: With `libshmemdf`, sample numbers now travel with samples. I need
      to use this to implement `asserts` in each component that (1) check that
      samples increase monotonically (buffer overflows means that samples can
      be skipped, so uniary incrementation is not a given) and (2) that
      multisource components are dealing with sychonized sample numbers when
      pull-based sychornization strategy is enforced (no external clock driving
      acqusition, so no chance for buffer overrun).
- [ ] Command line switches should take precedence over TOML file options.  This is
  standard practice, but is not how Oat works currently.
    - `oat-frameserve`
    - `oat-framefilt`
    - `oat-posifilt`
    - `oat-posigen`
    - `oat-posicom`
    - `oat-posidet`
- [ ] For (all?) most components, `configure` is pure abstract in the
  component's base class. This doesn't make too much sense because options are
  often common to many components. For instance, in `oat-posigen`, the sample
  period, and number of samples parameters are certainly relevant to any
  implementation of the position generator idea. Therefore, `configure` should
  be abstract with a base implementation containing guaranteed-to-be-common
  parameters. For components that have no common parameters, it can be left
  pure-abstract for the time being.
    - `oat-frameserve`
    - `oat-framefilt`
    - `oat-posifilt`
    - ~~`oat-posigen`~~
    - `oat-posicom`
    - `oat-posidet`
    - EDIT: There are not actually many components that have common
      configuration parameters among concrete types. `oat-posidet` and possibly
      `oat-frameserve` seem like the only candidates.
- [ ] [CBOR](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049) binary messaging and data files
  - CBOR is an extremely simple binary encoding scheme for JSON
  - It would be great to allow the option to save CBOR files (`oat-record`) or
    send CBOR messages (`oat-posisock`) by creating a CBOR `Writer` acceptable
    to by `Position` datatype's serialization function.
  - And, while I'm at it, Position's should be forced to support serialization,
    so this should be a pure abstract member of the base class.
  - Another option that is very similar is messagepack. Don't know which is
    better.
- [ ] `oat-framefilt undistort`
    - Very slow. Needs an OpenGL or CUDA implementation
    - User supplied frame rotation occurs in a separate step from un-distortion.
      Very inefficient. Should be able to combine rotation with camera matrix
      to make this a lot faster.
- [ ] It would be nice if PURE SINKs (e.g. `oat frameserve`) could have their 
  sample clock reset via user input, without having to restart the program. 
- [ ] It would be nice to be able to re-aquire the background image in 
  `oat-framefilt bsub` without have to restart the program.
